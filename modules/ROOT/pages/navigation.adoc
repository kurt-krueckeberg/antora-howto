= Understanding Antora Navigation

Antora naviagation is not built automatically; you must create navigation `.adoc` file(s). To do this, it is important first 
to understand Antora's modules folder and the related subfolder families. Complete details are in the https://docs.antora.org[Antora documentation].

After this overview, we can look at the basics of navigation files and then at an examples of actual Antora websites.

`antora.yml` is in the top directory of the repository that holds the `.adoc` content files of the website. Antora requires a particular directory
with subfolders with particular names. There is a top-level `modules` folder that contains one or more folders conceptually termed `components`. In the case of the
Asciidoc documentation, the folders under `moduels/` are: 

```bash
attributes
blocks
components-in-antora-yml.txt
directives
docinfo
document
lists
macros
pass
ROOT
sections
stem
subs
tables
text
toc
verbatim
```

These folders under modules are termed components of the documentation. It is recommended that you create the optional `ROOT` comonent directory to take
advantage of preset default behavoir applied to it.

== Family Directories 

The family directories are: attachments/, examples/, images/, pages/, partials/.

In the Antora project for the  https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[Asciidoc] documentation, for example, there are 25 `nav*.doc` entries in
`antora.yml` file and each of the 16 components (subfolders of modules) are represented with at least one entry:

```yml
nav:
- modules/ROOT/nav-top.adoc
- modules/blocks/nav-basics.adoc
- modules/attributes/nav-document.adoc
- modules/attributes/nav-element.adoc
- modules/document/nav.adoc
- modules/sections/nav.adoc
- modules/blocks/nav-paragraph.adoc
- modules/blocks/nav-discrete-headings.adoc
- modules/blocks/nav-breaks.adoc
- modules/text/nav.adoc
- modules/lists/nav.adoc
- modules/macros/nav.adoc
- modules/blocks/nav-styles.adoc
- modules/verbatim/nav.adoc
- modules/tables/nav.adoc
- modules/stem/nav.adoc
- modules/blocks/nav-open.adoc
- modules/blocks/nav-collapsible.adoc
- modules/ROOT/nav-comment.adoc
- modules/toc/nav.adoc
- modules/docinfo/nav.adoc
- modules/directives/nav.adoc
- modules/subs/nav.adoc
- modules/pass/nav.adoc
- modules/attributes/nav-ref.adoc
```

Some component/folder occur more than once as shown below:

```bash
  3 attributes
  7 blocks
  1 directives
  1 docinfo
  1 document
  1 lists
  1 macros
  1 pass
  2 ROOT
  1 sections
  1 stem
  1 subs
  1 tables
  1 text
  1 toc
  1 verbatim
```

== Basic of Navigation and Navigation Files

Antora's https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/navigation/[Navigation Assembly] explains that 

----
Each component (each component version to be precise) requires navigation
files that are stored along with its source files.

Strictly speaking the navigation for a compoent (component version) doesn't
have to be in that modules folder, but this is a common practice. Furthermore,
the navigation for the component can be made up of more than one `.adoc` file.
----

The navigatoin files is defined thus:

----
A navigation file contains one or more bulleted lists. Each item in a list can
be the cross reference to a page, URL to a website that isnâ€™t part of the site,
or unlinked text such as a category title that groups a nested set of list items.
You can compose the navigation from multiple files.
in other modules and components, too. Here are examples:
----

The navigation files are unordered lists in `.adoc` files, usually named starting with
`nav` but can be named anything. The top level items action as the top-level menu
text. The most common items in a navigation file are `xrefs`` to pages that belong
to the same component version and module, but a target resource ID can be for pages.

Unordered lists they can have titles that are introducted with a line that begins with a `.`
In a navigation unordered list such text is simply not clickable or actionable.

```adoc
._Support_
* https://support.project.com[Get Help]
* xref:help.adoc[*Troubleshooting*]

.Kizmet's Favorite Authors
* Edgar Allan Poe
* Sheri S. Tepper
* Bill Bryson
```

`.Understanding Geneaolgy Research` is unlinked text that appears as top-leve navigation text. It becomes a collapsibile menu with one
item, whose text is the H1 header in `index.adoc`. Under this top-level collapsible menu are two text choices whose text 
also comes from the H1 text in the specified `.adoc` files. 

If the navigation file had been:

```adoc
.Understanding Geneaolgy Research
* xref:antora-intro.adoc[]
** xref:ui-antora.adoc[]
```

their would be a second, nested collapsible menu.

Taking the H1 headers as the menu text occurs when no link text is specifed as in `* xref:antora-intro.adoc[]`.

== Analysis of Navigation for Two Real Sites

In the navigation for the site, the main, top-level entries come from first navigation entry in antora.yml navigation `moduelses/ROOT/nav-top.adoc`:

Below is the navigation for Asciidoc documentation site
image:asciidoc-navigation.jpg[Asciidoc Navigation]

which has this content:

```adoc
* Introduction
** xref:document-structure.adoc[]
** xref:key-concepts.adoc[]
** xref:document-processing.adoc[]
** xref:normalization.adoc[]
```

**Introduction** is the text of the first menu item, which is collapsible with four sub menu items. This appearance comes from the 
unordered lists in `ROOT/nav-top.adoc`:

```adoc
* Introduction
** xref:document-structure.adoc[]
** xref:key-concepts.adoc[]
** xref:document-processing.adoc[]
** xref:normalization.adoc[]
```

where unordered list of one item has a nested unordered list of four items. The menu item of the four submenu items comes from the h1-level header
in the cross reference `.adoc` files, which are in their components `pages` subfolder. Here are those entries for the files above:

```adoc
= Document Structure
= Key Concepts
= Document Processing
= Normalization
```

So we see menu item text can come from either text in a navigation `.adoc` file or from the first line, the h1 header `= ...`, in the cross referenced
`.adoc` file within the navigaton file. 

Recall that `.adoc` files that are not navigation must reside in a `pages/` folder as do the cross referenced files above.

=== Digging Deeper

The next menu item `Blocks` likewise is collapsibile. It is created in exactly like `ROOT/nav-top.adoc` above. The `nav-basics.adoc` file in the
`blocks` component

```adoc
* xref:index.adoc[]
** xref:delimited.adoc[]
** xref:build-basic-block.adoc[]
** xref:add-title.adoc[]
** xref:assign-id.adoc[]
** xref:masquerading.adoc[]
** xref:troubleshoot-blocks.adoc[]
```

is the same except the first entry is the text of an unordered list item but instead a cross reference. All the file above come from the `modules/block/pages` folder.
There top level headers are:

```adoc
= Blocks
= Delimited Blocks
= Document Title
= Build a Basic Block
= Add a Title to a Block
= Assign an ID
= Block Masquerading
= Troubleshooting Blocks
```

todo: display Blocks menu item

which comprise the `Blocks` drop down and its nested items. However, the `blocks` component folder has other naviation files, which are listed later in 
the `antora.yml` file. Thus, a component may have more than one naviation `.adoc` file that controls later sections of the site's naviation. Take, for
example, the `Paragraphs` menu:

todo: display Paragraphs menu item
