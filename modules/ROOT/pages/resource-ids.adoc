= Resource IDs

A resource is a source file that belongs to the pages, images, partials, examples, or attachments family.
Antora assigns each resource a unique identifier called an Antora resource ID

== Referencing Pages

tâ€™s the same way for page IDs. If you want to reference a page stored in the same module as the current page, which is most often the case, you only need to specify the filename of the other page.

[,asciidoc]
----
xref:page-in-same-module.adoc[link text]
----

If you want to reference a page in a different module, you only need to specify the module and filename of the other page:

[,asciidoc]
----
xref:sibling-module:page.adoc[link text]
----

To reference another version of a page in the same module, just prepend the version number to the filename.

[,asciidoc]
----
xref:1.1@page.adoc[link text]
----

You only have to use the full page ID when you need to refer to a page that belongs to another component.

[,asciidoc]
----
xref:2.1@other-component:module:page.adoc[link text]
----
